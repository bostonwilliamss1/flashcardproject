# Overview
Spanish Flashcard App

This is a app where you can practice your Spanish. There are 9 different categories on the home page that you can select from. Once you have selected the category you would like to study it takes you to a different page to study a set of words. You can keep practicing as long as you would like until you feel like you have got it down.

The purpose in creating this app is so that students have a place to study a few words whenever they feel like they have the time. It makes it easy to quiz yourself!

# Development Environment

I had to download Flutter and Flutter SDK. I used Visual Studio Code to code my project in. I also used an IPhone simulator from Xcode, which was really helpful.

Dart is the programming language used to write Flutter applications.

# Future Work

This project took me a lot longer than I thought it would but I was glad that I was able to get done, what I was able to. If I had more time I would have tried to add these things:  
* Customizable flashcards
* A log in
* Different Languages/Topics
